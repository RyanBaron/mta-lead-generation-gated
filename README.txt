Add a restrict to individual pages/posts that incorporates a Gravity Form & fires on exit intent or after a specified amount of time.

== Description ==

MTA Lead Generation Gated give administrators the ability to add a responsive restrict to individual pages and posts that incorporates a Gravity Form and fires on exit intent or after a specified amount of time.

The restrict offers 3 layouts options and a variety of optional headline and text fields that allow administrators to add their own form specific content to the restrict.

A few notes about the sections above:

* You must have Gravity Forms installed to use this plugin
* Local storage is used to determine if the user has seen the page restrict in the last 7 days and will not show the user the restrict if they have.
* Upon restrict or dismissal a Lead Generation event is pushed to google analytics
* The plugin uses Flexbox to center the restrict on the page.
* Lead Generation Gateds can be added to any page or post (including custom post types).
